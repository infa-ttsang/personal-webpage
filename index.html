	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>Hi there! I'm a computer science student at the University of Pennsylvania. As a Bay Area native, I grew up inspired by innovation and technology. I also love working on big, impactful projects. In particular, I am passionate about cloud computing, quantum computing, and bioinformatics. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, electronic dance music, and exploring subcultures. I love connecting with people, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything on this page!</p>

	<h1>Current and Recent Projects</h1>

	<h2>BE 495: Senior Design Project</h2>
	<p> As a senior at Penn, I am working on my capstone engineering project! I am on an interdiscplinary team with members in bioengineering, mechnical engineering, and computer science. We are designing a dynamic compression stocking for several stakeholders: athletes, frequent flyers on airplines, and patients with medical conditions such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). As a computer scientist, I am utilizing IoT to control compression movements in the stocking. For the purpose of health history and tracking, I am also creating a mobile app for iOS and Android using Lua programming. This year-long project is still in progress!</p>

	<h2>Microsoft Software Engineer Intern</h2>
	<p> During the summer of 2020, I interned at Azure Data's CosmosDB team. I added a new feature, which was to expose the SQL API through the Cassandra API. I also made cross-team contributions because of the interdiscplinary nature of my project. This was my first time interning at a large technology company. Even though it was virutal, it was transformative in the sense that I learned a lot about industry-standard software development practices. I can also attest to the Microsoft's amazing culture and hope to visit the Redmond campus again one day!</p>

	<h2>KPCB Engineering Fellow at Shape Security</h2>
	<p> During the summer of 2019, I was a KPCB Fellow at Shape Security, a cybersecurity startup which mitigates automated bot attacks. As a software engineer intern, I work as part of the cloud development team to deploy applications to the cloud using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Kubernetes. This was my first time working at a startup, and I enjoyed its collaborative and fast paced culture.</p>

	<h2>University of Pennsylvania Research Intern</h2>
	<p> During my sophomore year, I was part of <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/shenlab/" target="_blank">Professor Li Shen's</a> research group in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics. As a lab member, I applied my computer science skills to questions in healthcare and biotechnology, an area I enjoy exploring. I developed a data mining pipeline to identify drug-drug interaction (DDI) patterns from health record databases. I managed these DDI patterns using MongoDB and Node.js and automated the conversion of DDI pattern results to a graphic representation on the web browser using Python. This work can be found in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079342/pdf/12911_2020_Article_1053.pdf" target="_blank">this published manuscript</a>.</p>

	<h2>Informatica Software Engineer Intern</h2>
	<p> During the summer of 2018, I interned at Informatica's Cloud Development group. I automated the end-to-end orchestration of the Informatica Intelligent Cloud Service (IICS) product deployment. My project helped decrease pod deployment time from 3 days to 2 hours, thus saving over $1 million in the pod disaster recovery budget.</p>
